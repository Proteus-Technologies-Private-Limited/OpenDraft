/**
 * The reordering, across the scripts that share it.
 *
 * Devanagari has its own file — it is where the algorithm was written and its
 * tests read it closely. These cover what generalising it brought in: the
 * scripts whose pre-base sign is a different code point, the ones that have
 * none at all, and the vowels written as one character and drawn as two.
 *
 * Written in escapes rather than in the scripts themselves. A reordering is
 * invisible in rendered text — a correct result and a wrong one look identical
 * in an editor that shapes them — so the only honest way to assert on it is
 * code point by code point.
